Hi guys. Please follow these conventions:

- perform a pull before pushing;
- push only WORKING code. Dao implementations, junit tests are appreciated;
- package it.unical.asde.uam.dao contains "DAO" interface and "DAOImp" class.
 These represent the REFERENCE for implementing our custom DAOs.
 So for example, if I want to create a DAO for the "Exam" entity, I have to do the following:
create a class named "ExamDAOImp" that extends DAOImp<Exam>
(public class ExamDAOImp extends DAOImp<Exam> {....}) and implement my custom methods (create(), delete(), getExamB)




- write your name at the top of classes you create. For example:

/**
*
* @author Fabrizio
*/
